One of my old codings in Python.
Functional and suitable for recorded videos on the Adobe Connect platform.
ٍEnjoy it ;)

Requirements:
- python 2.7 or 3
- wget, unzip, and ffmpeg accessible from command line.

Examples:
python connect2vid_v2.py https://my.adobeconnect.com/pqc06mcawjgn/  --output_filename=" Understanding how the Network impacts your service"

Please email me if you improve this code.

Also you can try this way to Export an AdobeConnect recording as a video:

1-Log into your Adobe Connect account
2-Click on Meetings > My Meetings
3-Click on the link for the recording
4-Click the “Recordings” link (right-side of screen)
5-Click the link in the “Name” column
6-Copy the “URL for Viewing” – Example, http://mycompany.adobeconnect.com/p12345678/
7-Paste it into a new browser tab then add the following to the end of the URL: output/filename.zip?download=zip
8-Your URL should look similar to this example, http://mycompany.adobeconnect.com/p12345678/output/filename.zip?download=zip
